### ❁ Some Projects Undertaken

➤ [Generating realistic images using GANs and DCGANs](https://iq.opengenus.org/deep-convolutional-gans-pytorch/)

* Trained GANs and Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST databases.
* Used different hyperparameters to train the models than those used by authors in the original research papers
* Generated new example images for both datasets, along with showing how the performance of DCGAN was better than GAN for the same task<br>

➤ [Face Aging using Conditional GANs](https://iq.opengenus.org/face-aging-cgan-keras/)

* Using the Keras framework, built a Face Aging network which takes an image of a person and generates an image of the same person older in age<br>

➤ [Image to Image Translation using CycleGANs](https://iq.opengenus.org/image-to-image-translation-cyclegan/)

* Implemented the `pix2pix algorithm` using CycleGAN on the Keras framework<br><br>
